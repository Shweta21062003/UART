# UART
This project implements a UART system in Verilog HDL with transmitter and receiver modules, verified using a testbench in ModelSim. It simulates accurate serial data transmission and reception between digital modules, demonstrating waveform-level validation and core concepts in communication, RTL design, and testbench-driven simulation.
